# Analysing Key Performance Indicators Leading to Customer Churn in Banks
 The project aims to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) that contribute to customer churn within the banking industry. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, a classification model will be developed to identify patterns and predictors of customer churn. This model will enable banks to proactively address factors leading to customer attrition, ultimately improving customer retention strategies and enhancing overall business performance.
